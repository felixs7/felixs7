My Gitlab repo contains some private projects around different topics I find interesting. Here is a short overview:

The latest project I've been working on is an example of a full end-to-end analytics pipeline using modern cloud technologies. 
It shows my technical ability around Data Preprocessing using Python, dbt, Airflow, and AWS services such as Redshift, EC2 and VPCS as well as Data Visualisation skills using Tableau as the BI-tool.

**New York Times Articles ETL using Airflow, S3, Python, dbt and Redshift and Ubuntu (hosted on EC2) **
- Project demonstrates a practical ETL pipeline to extract daily article data from the New York Times API
- It extracts daily article data from the New York Times API, performs transformations, and stores the data in an S3 bucket.
- The data is then loaded into Redshift, and a dbt model creates a reporting view for analysis.
- The pipeline is orchestrated using Airflow, running on an Ubuntu EC2 instance.
- The solution follows best practices for data engineering and supports both production and QA environments with separate S3 buckets and Redshift databases.
